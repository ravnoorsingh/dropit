  /*
  data refers to the object being validated by the schema.

In this context, data is an object with the properties: email, password, and passwordConfirmation.
When Zod validates an input against signUpSchema, it passes the entire input object as data to the .refine() function.
The function checks if data.password and data.passwordConfirmation are equal, ensuring the user typed the same password twice.
In summary:
data is the userâ€™s submitted form data (the object being validated by the schema).*/
